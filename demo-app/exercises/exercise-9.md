# Exercise 9

1. Create a pipe named Ellipsis pipe. The pipe will receive a string of text. The second argument to the pipe will be a number indicating the number of characters of text to display before dropping the remaining text and showing an ellipsis.

2. If the number of characters in the string is less the second argument value then show the entire string and no ellipsis.

3. Demonstrate the pipe by wiring up a textarea control. When the user types into the textarea display the text in the template using a template expression. Apply the ellipsis pipe to the template expression.

4. You will need to setup whatever Angular parts are necessary to complete the code above.

5. Ensure it works!
