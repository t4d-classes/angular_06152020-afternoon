## Configuration and Data for the REST API part of the class

To configure the REST API, two packages will need to installed into the project created by the Vue CLI generator.

To install those packages, run the following command from within the root folder of the project:

```bash
npm install -D json-server npm-run-all
```

Next, the `package.json` needs to be updated to easily run the REST API provides by the [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). Here is the `scripts` configuration which can be copied and pasted for the REST API. When asked by the instructor, replace the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file in the `demo-app` project with the `scripts` section below.

```json
"scripts": {
  "ng": "ng",
  "start": "run-p rest web",
  "rest": "json-server --port 3060 ./db.json",
  "web": "ng serve",
  "build": "ng build",
  "test": "ng test",
  "lint": "ng lint",
  "e2e": "ng e2e"
},
```

Here is the `db.json` JSON which can be copied and pasted for the REST API portion of the class. This content will pasted into a file named `db.json`. The `db.json` file will be placed in the `demo-app` folder, the same folder as the `package.json` file. The `db.json` file should **NOT** be placed in the `src` folder.

```json
{
  "colors": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "red", "hexcode": "#ff0000" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "green", "hexcode": "#00ff00" },
    { "id": 3, "name": "blue", "hexcode": "#0000ff" }
  ],
  "cars": [
    {"id":1,"make":"Ford","model":"Fusion Hybrid","year":2019,"color":"blue","price":45000},
    {"id":2,"make":"Tesla","model":"S","year":2018,"color":"red","price":100000}
  ]
}
```
